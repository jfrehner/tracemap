  <h2>About us</h2>
  <p>
    Hi! Thanks for visiting our site!
    We are a team of two students at the university of applied sciences in switzerland. In one of our courses we had to build a web-app with different web-technologies.
    You are now looking at the result of our work.
  </p>
  <h2>How tracemap works</h2>
  <p>
    Normally, the output of a traceroute-command in the terminal is quite technical and not fun to look at. That's why we decided to build a 'traceroute'-visualizer and beautify all the information. This app works through executing a 'traceroute'-command
    on our server (who stands somewhere in great, big Canada) and sending all the received 'hops' (aka IP-addresses) to a geolocater API (a shoutout to the folks at <a href="http://www.ip-api.com">ip-api.com</a> who provide their service for free!). The received
    geolocation-info is then put into a google-map and the different hops are linked with a beautiful line, so one can follow a request from start to finish (hopefully).
  </p>
  <h2>Why does my traceroute always start in Canada?</h2>
  <p>
    Our server is located in Canada and the traceroute command is executed on the server. Unfortunately, it is not possible to start a traceroute command on your computer through the browser.
  </p>
  <h2>Some considerations</h2>
  <p>
    It would not be a real-world web-app if there would be completely no problems... (sadly). It can be that the app prints out rather intertwined paths the request takes. Unfortunately, geolocation of an ip-address is not that easy, and the free database we're using
    can have some wrong locations for a given ip. Furthermore it is possible that a 'traceroute' never reaches an end - hops in between the start and your desired destination address may block a traceroute-request for various (mostly security) reasons.
    So - don't be sad if you once in a while should not get a request or if the path from start to finish looks a bit funny. Just put in another destination-url, press return and enjoy once more an interesting journey through cables and routers!
    Have fun!
  </p>
  <h2>How to use the app</h2>
  <ol class="manual">
    <li>
      <div>
        <span>
          Go to the <a href="#" class="view-tracemap">main site</a> and enter the destination (this has to be a valid url e.g. www.google.com, otherwise the "Trace it"-Button will be disabled until the url in the input field is valid) for which you want to execute a traceroute. Click the "Trace it"-Button.
        </span>
        <img src="./img/tracemap-start.png" alt="tracemap-startpage"/>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <span>
          The "Trace it"-Button will change to "Loading data...". There will now be a table below the google map that displays all the data of the traceroute-request. The table, as well as the google map are live updated. On the table you see the country, the hop is in (if a country could be identified), the hopnumber the ip as well as the hostname.
          Last but not least the three response time to each of the hops are displayed (or * for the response time if the hop did not respond).
        </span>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <span>
          Once the request is finished the "Trace it"-Button changes its text to "Trace it"-again (and to a nice blue color) and an additional linegraph about the hoptimes is displayed. On this graph you see one line for each of the three response-times per hop. On the x-axis you see the hopnumber and on the y-axis you see the reponse-time in miliseconds.
        </span>
        <img src="./img/tracemap-output.png" alt="tracemap-output"/>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <span>
          Enjoy the data!
        </span>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    If you wish, you can go to the <a href="#" class="view-statistics">statistics-page</a> and look at some statistical data we collected. On the google map you see the ten destinations the most traceroutes are executed for (together with a nice line connecting the server location with the destination location). Below the map you can see a table with general statistical data, a graph that displays the relation of the amounts of the top ten traced destinations together with a corresponding table.
